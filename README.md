"# Supermarket-project-v2.0" 

About:

The Supermarket project is inspired by my current parttime job at a grocery store, it is my first big Java project.

This project does not include the class used to connect to the database, this is due to private information. Because of this, most of the functionality will not work if you've pulled the project through GitHub.

The project is based around a management system, but with a bit of a twist. Although it is a management system, primarily based around database connections and queries, you can choose as which "function" you want to run the program

For example, you may want to run the program as a manager, which gives you access to all the functionality, but you can also run the program as an employee, which gives you functions limited to changing your information and buying products.

This version of the Supermarket Project is the second version, the big difference between the first and second version of the project, is the implementation of MVC (Model, View, Controller) in the second version, as well as extra functionality.



MVC:

MVC is used to split up the existing classes into three layers, the Model, the View and the Controller. The model consists of most of the functionality an ordinary class has. The Controller is used to communicate with and between the model and the view. The view is used to view information to the viewer, in this case to print the necessary information.
